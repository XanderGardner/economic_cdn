Godzilla Minus One (Japanese: ゴジラ-1.0マイナスワン, Hepburn: Gojira Mainasu Wan) is a 2023 Japanese kaiju film directed, written, and with visual effects by Takashi Yamazaki. Produced by Toho Studios and Robot Communications and distributed by Toho,[4] it is the 37th film in the Godzilla franchise, Toho's 33rd Godzilla film, and the fifth film in the franchise's Reiwa era.[a] The film stars Ryunosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Yuki Yamada, Munetaka Aoki, Hidetaka Yoshioka, Sakura Ando, and Kuranosuke Sasaki. In the film, postwar Japan deals with the emergence of Godzilla.

After the release of his film The Great War of Archimedes (2019), Yamazaki was selected to make a Godzilla film. He subsequently wrote the script over the course of three years, taking influence from the original 1954 Godzilla film and Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah (2001), Jaws (1975), and the films of Hayao Miyazaki. Yamazaki had previously depicted Godzilla in Always: Sunset on Third Street 2 (2007) and a 2021 amusement-park ride at Seibu-en. In February 2022, Robot publicized that Yamazaki was soon to begin directing a kaiju film via a casting call on their website. Filming occurred primarily in Kantō and Chūbu from March to June 2022. Shirogumi handled the visual effects at their studio in Chōfu from April 2022 to May 2023.

The red carpet premiere was at the Shinjuku Toho Building on October 18, 2023, as the closing film at the 36th Tokyo International Film Festival. Toho released it theatrically in Japan on November 3, the same date as the first Godzilla film's release in 1954, to celebrate the franchise's 70th anniversary.[b] The film has been a critical and commercial success, grossing $57 million against an under $15 million budget. American critics praised its visual effects, direction, story, characters, musical score, and social commentary, and compared it favorably to recent Hollywood films.[8] It received four nominations at the 48th Hochi Film Awards, with Yamazaki winning Best Director, and is a finalist for Best Visual Effects at the 96th Academy Awards.[9]

Plot
In 1945, near the end of World War II, kamikaze pilot Kōichi Shikishima feigns technical issues with his plane and lands on Odo Island. Lead mechanic Tachibana implies that Shikishima fled from his duty. That night, a dinosaur-like creature, Godzilla, attacks. Shikishima gets in his plane but cannot bring himself to shoot the monster and is knocked unconscious. He wakes up to learn that Tachibana is the only survivor, who blames Shikishima for failing to act.


The Operation Crossroads nuclear test that resulted in the mutation of Godzilla in the film.
In 1946, Shikishima returns home to find his parents were killed in the bombing of Tokyo. Plagued by survivor's guilt, he works as a minesweeper and begins supporting a woman, Noriko Ōishi, whose parents also died in the bombing, and an orphaned baby, Akiko, whom Noriko rescued.

Later that year, Godzilla is mutated and enlarged by the United States' Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll; it destroys several U.S. warships before heading for Japan. The U.S. refuses help, owing to tensions with the Soviet Union, but General Douglas MacArthur sends decommissioned Imperial Japanese Navy vessels.

In May 1947, Shikishima and his minesweeper crew are tasked with stopping Godzilla's approach to Japan, in reality stalling for time for larger vessels to arrive. They release a mine into Godzilla's mouth and detonate it, doing significant damage, but it quickly regenerates. The heavy cruiser Takao then arrives and engages Godzilla but is subsequently destroyed when Godzilla unleashes its atomic "heat ray".

After returning to Tokyo, Shikishima tells Noriko about the attack and his earlier encounter with Godzilla. Days later, Godzilla makes landfall in Japan, attacking Ginza, where Noriko works. Noriko narrowly avoids dying and is found by Shikishima. Type 4 Chi-To medium tanks engage Godzilla, but it fires its heat ray, which causes a nuclear explosion that obliterates Ginza, killing tens of thousands. Noriko pushes Shikishima into an alley but is caught in the blast herself and presumed dead. Devastated by the loss of Noriko, Shikishima vows revenge against Godzilla.

Godzilla departs but is expected to return; the government refuses to do more to prevent another attack. One of the minesweeper's crew, former Naval engineer Kenji Noda, plans to destroy Godzilla by surrounding it with Freon tanks and rupturing them, lowering the water's buoyancy and sinking it to a depth of 1,500 meters, letting the resultant pressure crush it. Should that plan fail, balloons will be inflated under Godzilla to force it back up to the surface, killing it through explosive decompression. He has commandeered the disarmed destroyers: Yukikaze, Hibiki, Yūkaze and Keyaki to enact his plan. Noda also gathers a group of private citizen volunteers, mostly Navy veterans, to crew the former warships. Shikishima recruits Tachibana, the mechanic he fought alongside, to repair a broken-down Kyushu J7W Shinden fighter. Shikishima plans to fly into Godzilla's mouth, then detonate an explosive charge inside the plane in an attempt to destroy the monster from the inside. He leaves Akiko in the care of his neighbor Sumiko, but tells Noda and the others that he will only be luring Godzilla into Noda's trap.

Godzilla resurfaces, and Shikishima draws it into the trap. After Godzilla is tricked into destroying two unmanned destroyers with its heat ray, the two remaining ships get close and wrap it in the buoys. Godzilla is then successfully dragged down to 1,500 meters but survives. The balloons are activated, forcing Godzilla up to 800 meters, but it survives and manages to break free. Two ships try to haul Godzilla to the surface but fail. A fleet of tugboats lend their assistance, and Godzilla is brought to the surface. Still alive and enraged, Godzilla prepares to destroy all the ships with its heat ray. Shikishima flies the explosive plane into Godzilla's mouth and remembers Tachibana imploring him to use the ejection seat, to let go of his survivor's guilt and choose to live. The plane explodes, destroying Godzilla's head and causing the energy of its heat ray to tear its body apart. The crew celebrates as Shikishima parachutes down, having chosen to live.

Shikishima receives a telegram and heads to the hospital with Akiko. They are reunited with Noriko, who survived the destruction, but has a black mark on her neck. Meanwhile, a chunk of Godzilla's flesh sinks into the ocean and begins to regenerate.

Production
Development
After the release of Toho's 2016 reboot Shin Godzilla, co-director Shinji Higuchi stated at the American fan convention G-Fest that Toho would not be able to produce another Godzilla film until after 2020; this was due to their contract with Legendary Pictures, who were producing their own Godzilla films, that forbade Toho from releasing their potential Godzilla films in the same year as Legendary's films.[11][12] In 2018, Toho executive Keiji Ota revealed that Shin Godzilla would not receive a sequel and expressed interest in a potential shared universe Godzilla series akin to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[13]

In 2019, following the release of his film The Great War of Archimedes, renowned filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki was appointed to make a Godzilla film.[14][15] He began preparing the project and initially spent one year developing the script. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the crew to postpone filming for a few years, leading to the script being rewritten several times over the course of three years.[14][16]

Godzilla Minus One is Yamazaki's third time working on a production utilizing Godzilla. His first is Always: Sunset on Third Street 2 (2007) which features the monster in a dream-like opening. During preproduction on Minus One, he also directed and created the effects for Seibu-en Amusement Park's motion simulator attraction Godzilla the Ride: Giant Monsters Ultimate Battle (2021).[17][18]

On February 18, 2022, Robot Communications announced the film, with the working title Blockbuster Monster Movie (超大作怪獣映画, Chōtaisaku Kaijū Eiga), via a casting call on their official website.[19][20] Robot stated Yamazaki would direct and that the film would be presented by Toho.[19] The next day, HuffPost writer Kenji Ando mentioned the conjecture from fans on social media whether the film would be a remake of the 1954 film. Ando also noted that it is a period piece set in postwar Japan between 1945 and 1947, citing Yamazaki's comments from an interview regarding his depiction of Godzilla in Always: Sunset on Third Street 2: "You can't have Godzilla unless it's the Shōwa era."[20]

Toho declared that Yamazaki's unnamed kaiju project is a Godzilla film on November 3, 2022, at an event celebrating the franchise's 68th anniversary known as "Godzilla Day". The company also revealed that the film had completed filming and had entered post-production with a targeted release date of November 3, 2023. Yamazaki was named the film's writer and visual effects supervisor.[21][22] During a press conference on December 13, 2022, Toho's head of planning Hisashi Usui implied that the new film is connected to the 1954 film.[23] Following the announcement, Yamazaki regaled his pitch and vision for the film:

Postwar Japan has lost everything. The film depicts an existence that gives unprecedented despair. The title Godzilla Minus One was created with this in mind. In order to depict this, the staff and I have worked together to create a setting where Godzilla looks as if "fear" itself is walking toward us, and where despair is piled on top of despair. I think this is the culmination of all the films I have made to date, and one that deserves to be "experienced" rather than "watched" in the theater. I hope you will experience the most terrifying Godzilla in the best possible environment.[4]

Writing
Yamazaki said that the worldwide anxiety and government unreliability during the pandemic was one of his major inspirations for the story[15][24] and that he hopes these events are reflected clearly.[15] Yamazaki later revealed that he was heavily influenced by Shusuke Kaneko's Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack (2001)—which he has cited as his favorite Godzilla film[25]—while writing the screenplay for Godzilla Minus One.[26] At its screening, he reflected in a discussion with Kaneko: "I had forgotten the contents of GMK for a while, but it seems like I self-consciously thought about it when writing the scenario for -1.0. Without realizing it, I was under considerable influence".[26]

Yamazaki has stated that Godzilla Minus One was inspired by the original 1954 Godzilla film,[27][15] Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975),[28] and the films of Hayao Miyazaki.[29] Godzilla (2014) director Gareth Edwards identified Spielberg's films Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and Jurassic Park (1993), and Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk (2017) as other evident influences on the film.[29]

A novelization of the film written by Yamazaki was published in Japan by Shueisha on November 8, 2023.[30][31]

Design
The design of Godzilla in Minus One is a variation of the one in Godzilla the Ride.[32][33] Inspired by the Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack design, Yamazaki initially envisioned his design having "half-moon shaped eyes", but modeling head Kosuke Taguchi gave it "almond-shaped" ones instead, with the final design having "golden, almond-shaped eyes".[33]

Yamazaki attempted to make this Godzilla the most horrifying version yet. The crew designed Godzilla to be ferocious, violent, and dynamic, with a static, god-like aspect. Its dorsal fins were made more "spiky and ferocious" than the incarnation in Godzilla the Ride, as if its regenerative energy had become disorderly. Yamazaki stated that the team also tried to make Godzilla the "deadliest in history" adding that it is "discerning today, experiencing the freshness and fear felt by audiences at the time".[33]

Casting
Producer Minami Ichikawa offered Ryunosuke Kamiki and Minami Hamabe the leading roles as a married couple in the film prior to them playing similar roles in the NHK drama series Ranman (2023).[14]

Filming

The replica of the Kyushu J7W Shinden is at the Tachiarai Peace Memorial Museum.
Principal photography took place on location in the Kantō and Chūbu (in the Aichi and Nagano prefectures) regions of Honshu, starting on March 17, 2022, and wrapping circa June 11.[19][20][34] According to Robot's website, the film would be set between 1945 and 1947, so there would be restrictions on the extras' costume sizes, hairstyles (declaring that long-haired men must have perms), and hair colors (declaring that hair dyeing would not be allowed).[19] The film's maritime sequences were filmed at Lake Hamana and in the Enshū Sea.[35] Between April and June 2022, several community businesses near the Tenryū River helped the crew modify and maintain boats to shoot navy scenes in Enshū.[35] Another shooting location was Okaya, Nagano.[36]

During production, scenes featuring the Kyushu J7W Shinden were partly realised through the construction of a 1:1 scale replica of the aircraft, of which only a single example exists and is located outside Japan in the collection of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C..[37] Following the completion of shooting, the replica was transported to and put on display at the Tachiarai Peace Memorial Museum in Chikuzen, Fukuoka in July 2022.[38] Toho donated the replica under anonymity, only revealing their involvement in the construction of the model after Minus One released.[39]

Production was widely reported to have had a budget of US$15 million[c] (roughly ¥2.2 billion),[43][44] under 10% of the previous Godzilla film’s budget, Godzilla vs. Kong (2021), produced by the American film company Legendary.[40] However, Yamazaki indicated at the 2023 Tokyo Comic Con that the budget was in fact less than that, saying "I wish it were that much".[2] Beforehand, Yamazaki also denied that the budget was ¥1 billion, claiming that it cost much more.[45]

Visual effects
Visual effects were handled by Shirogumi at its studio in Chōfu,[46] under the supervision of Yamazaki[21] and direction of Kiyoko Shibuya.[47][d] The team began creating the effects for Godzilla Minus One around April 2022, per the TV Shinshu special about Yamazaki that was released the following year.[46] Shirogumi revealed by opening a recruitment call for visual effects designers and compositors in August 2022, that post-production had begun and visual effects were taking place from that same month until January 2023;[49] they later changed the dates to between November 2022 and February 2023.[50] Their website named the 3D animation software Houdini and Maya for design and Nuke for compositing.[49][50] Post-production concluded in late May 2023, after the visual effects were finished.[51]

During an interview alongside Shinji Higuchi (co-director of Shin Godzilla), Yamazaki noted that Godzilla's scenes of destruction in Minus One were inspired by Higuchi's effects from Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris, directed by Shusuke Kaneko.[52]

Music
Main article: Godzilla Minus One (soundtrack)
Yamazaki's frequent collaborator Naoki Satō scored the film. Rambling Records [ja] released Godzilla Minus One Original Soundtrack, on CD in Japan on October 28, 2023. A limited edition vinyl is scheduled to follow on November 24.[53][54] Stock tracks composed by Akira Ifukube for King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962) and Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964) were used for some scenes.[55]

Marketing
On June 12, 2023, the film's Twitter account began a daily countdown for all of Toho's live-action Godzilla films, starting with its previous live-action film Shin Godzilla.[56] On July 11, Toho lifted the embargo on its secret kaiju film project, which was revealed as Godzilla Minus One. The film was announced with a teaser trailer, poster (which was primarily designed by Yamazaki), and release dates for Japan and the United States.[57][58][e] Merchandise for the film was unveiled the next day with a full-body shot of Godzilla.[62]

On July 13, Tamashii unveiled its Godzilla toy for its S.H. MonsterArts line; the toy was sculpted by Yuki Sakai under Yamazaki's supervision and based on 3D data from the film.[63] A series of pre-release products and an exhibit promoting the film was at the exhibition "The Visual World-crafting of YAMAZAKI Takashi [sic], Film Director" in Yamazaki's hometown of Matsumoto in Nagano Prefecture, from July 15 to October 29.[62][64] A 2-meter tall Godzilla statue was exhibited at the 2023 Summer Wonder Festival on July 30.[65] At the request of Toho, Hiroaki Fukushi spent roughly one month creating a statue of Godzilla, dubbed "Godzilla Neputa", to promote the film at the Aomori Nebuta Matsuri from August 4 to 8.[66]

Two days after releasing a new teaser,[67] Toho released its official trailer alongside the theatrical release poster, central cast and staff members on September 4.[7][68] On September 14, 15 shots and a visual of Godzilla from the film were released; ticket sales (via Mubichike Online) and flyers for its November 3 release were released the following day.[69][70][71] On September 14, SciFi Japan reported that the film had remained the top trending film on social media sites in Japan and the United States, with the trailer accumulating over 9 million views on YouTube.[72]

During a press conference on September 25, Hamamatsu, the city bordering Lake Hamana (where some scenes in the film were shot), announced that it would promote the film to make the location a tourist attraction by preparing for "location cruising" at the lake in late October.[35] On October 7, behind-the-scenes footage of the making of Godzilla Minus One was broadcast on Channel 4 of TV Shinshu, as part of a television special on Yamazaki, which was narrated by Hidetaka Yoshioka.[73] Toho declared on October 16 that Godzilla Minus One would be the first Japanese movie screened in the 270-degree panoramic film format ScreenX.[74]

On October 18, Yamazaki and the film's stars attended its red carpet premiere along Godzilla Street in Kabukichō, Shinjuku; the red carpet was 50.1 meters in length, which is the fictitious height of Godzilla in Godzilla Minus One.[75][76] Television stations across Japan began airing a television special on Godzilla Minus One in late October.[77] It features interviews with Yamazaki, Kamiki, and Hamabe, and behind-the-scenes footage.[77] On October 23, Yamazaki, Kamiki, and Hamabe attended the red carpet at the opening of the 36th Tokyo International Film Festival.[78] To promote the film in Japan, soft drink manufacture Cheerio released a new Chūhai drink called the "Godzilla Energy Chu-hi [sic]" on November 6.[79]

Selected screenings
On August 24, it was announced that, as a prelude to the release of Godzilla Minus One, Yamazaki had selected "4 Godzilla Works" for screenings in September and October.[80] An accompanying "talk show" took place before each screening, with Shin Godzilla and Shin Ultraman (2022) director Shinji Higuchi serving as the guest for the screening of the original 1954 Godzilla film, and suitmaker Keizō Murase serving as the guest for the screening of Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster (1964).[81] The third and fourth Godzilla films selected by Yamazaki for screenings are Shusuke Kaneko's Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack (2001), and a new black-and-white version of Shin Godzilla created by Hideaki Anno, Higuchi and Katsuro Onoue, respectively.[82] Kaneko and Anno were also the guests at the talk shows for their respective films.[82]

Collaborative projects
The film was promoted at the Tokyo Dome in collaboration with the Yomiuri Giants in their match against the Tokyo Yakult Swallows, taking place on October 1. A "special collaboration" video and a 3.6-meter statue of Godzilla were displayed at the venue.[83] On September 27, Fujita Kanko stated in a press release that the Hakone Kowakien Yunessun hot spring theme park in Hakone, Kanagawa Prefecture would hold an event in collaboration with the film from October 20, 2023, to January 8, 2024.[84]

Critical response

Ryunosuke Kamiki received praise for his performance, and Takashi Yamazaki received praise for his direction, screenplay, and visual effects.
Godzilla Minus One has received universal critical acclaim.[113][114] According to The Hollywood Reporter, American film critics have concertedly complimented the film because of Yamazaki's impressive tiny-budgeted visuals, its touching human drama, and the usage of the kaiju metaphor for social commentary.[115] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 97% based on 119 reviews, with an average score of 8.3/10. The site's consensus reads, "With engaging human stories anchoring the action, Godzilla Minus One is one kaiju movie that remains truly compelling between the scenes of mass destruction."[116] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 79 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[117] American audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, and polls by PostTrak gave it a 92% overall positive score, with 83% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[108]

Screen International critic Tim Grierson felt "there’s a reverence shown to Godzilla Minus One’s gruesome colossus; audiences may cheer the havoc it wreaks, but Yamazaki understands Godzilla’s sombre societal implications."[118] But Why Tho's Sarah Musnicky gave the film 9 out of 10 stars, saying it "will win the hearts of fans everywhere. Not just for Godzilla, but for the human characters within that reminds us why it is important to infuse soul into a kaiju or monster film."[119] Time Out's reviewer gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, calling it "heartfelt and often awe-inspiring" and Godzilla "one scary bastard".[120]

Katie Rife, reviewing the film for IGN, gave the film 8 out of 10 stars, saying it is more "hopeful" than Shin Godzilla with "more swell, in the score and on the heart strings; less terror and more pride, even (or perhaps especially) while evoking a vulnerable period in Japan's history".[121] Variety's reviewer said the film's "emotionally engaging storyline" and "heat-ray-breathing action", makes it a "high point in the long-running series". Collider rated the film "B+", expressing that the film "balances sweeping spectacle and tense action with the more complicated themes of war and loss, making it a solid monster movie that hardly ever makes a wrong step."[122] James Berardinelli acclaimed the film's effects, spectacle, screenplay, set and sound design, cinematography, and character development; dubbing it "an excellent Godzilla movie – arguably among the best ever to grace the screen".[123]

In a more mixed review by Matt Schley of The Japan Times believing the film "evokes the original film more than any Godzilla film since the ’50s", he states its period piece setting "avoids taking on contemporary issues, more content to be an entertaining ride than use Japan’s most malleable monster as a metaphor for what ails us".[124]

Other responses
Hideaki Anno, co-director of Shin Godzilla, called the film "well-made" and praised the film's technical prowess, saying that Japan has improved in the field of visual effects.[125] Godzilla (2014) director Gareth Edwards admitted to feeling "jealous", adding that "this is what a Godzilla movie should be" and that the film should be "mentioned as a candidate for the best Godzilla movie of all time".[126][127] At the film's American premiere, Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) director Michael Dougherty told Yamazaki and Kamiki that the film was "amazing". Seth Green said "It's a movie filled with a lot of emotions, and I was very moved by it."[128]

Video game designer Hideo Kojima hailed the film, saying that "Godzilla, the plot, the VFX, Ifukube's music, Ms. Hamabe's appearance, and the applause afterward" were "nothing but pluses", joking that "the result was +120 points, so I would like to change the title".[129] Manga artist Aka Akasaka called the human drama "wonderful" and admitted that he cried during some scenes.[130] Television producer Nobuyuki Sakuma [ja] said that it was "both old and new" and "the power of Godzilla gave me goosebumps many times".[131] Yoshifumi Naoi [ja], the bassist of alternative rock band Bump of Chicken, called it a "truly terrific movie", adding: "in many ways, my body is numb even after watching it".[132] Comedian Shohei Osada watched the film three times, declaring it "too interesting".[133]

U.S. performance
Several American media analysts and journalists have noted how the film's critical and commercial success in the United States has outdone recent Hollywood tentpoles, particularly superhero films; and how the film delivered quality visual effects on a budget below $15 million, a low figure compared to Hollywood films. Comscore's senior analyst Paul Dergarabedian attributed the film's success to "outside-of-the-box thinking or movies that have a unique point of view, or not trying to just replicate what was successful before”. He compared the film to similarly successful 2023 films—such as Oppenheimer, Barbie, and Sound of Freedom—that also offered fresh and unorthodox experiences. Dergarabedian argued that audiences do not have fatigue to Godzilla or action films but fatigue to "bad movies". Saba Hamedy from NBC News said that the film proved that action films based on recycled characters can still find success.[114]

Sam Williamson from Collider attributed the film's box office success to its low budget. He noted that Japan's labor laws incentivize studios to keep costs low at the expense of the cast and crew. Japanese actor Kanji Furutachi stated that Japan lacks unions for actors and filmmakers, which brings a "low-quality environment with long hours and low wages" and rise to exploitation.[134]

Potential sequel
Director Takashi Yamazaki reflected on the film's ending: "I think it's more cinematic if it doesn't end neatly and properly. It's not just so a sequel can be made, it's also so the characters are kept alive in the hearts of the audience."[146] On the film's opening day, Yamazaki had expressed interest in directing another Godzilla film, saying: "I wonder if you'll let me shoot one more picture?
